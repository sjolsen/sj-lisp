;;;; FIXME: SPLIT-LIST and NSPLIT-LIST take a non-negative FIXNUM as their
;;;; length argument. This improves the code generated by SBCL significantly,
;;;; but is it the right thing to do? (INTEGER 0 MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM) should
;;;; probably be given a proper name either way.

;;;; Functions SPLIT-LIST, NSPLIT-LIST

;;; Given one list, return two freshly consed lists: a list containing the first
;;; N elements of LIST, and a list containing the rest of them. This is
;;; effectively the same as:
;;;
;;;    (VALUES (BUTLAST LIST (- (LENGTH LIST) N)
;;;            (COPY-LIST (LAST LIST (- (LENGTH LIST) N))))
;;;
;;; but a bit more efficient, visiting each cell exactly once. If the FROM-END
;;; argument is supplied and is non-NIL, it is equivalent to:
;;;
;;;    (VALUES (BUTLAST LIST N
;;;            (COPY-LIST (LAST LIST N)))
;;;
;;; but again, probably faster. See also NSPLIT-LIST.
