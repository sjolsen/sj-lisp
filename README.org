* General-purpose Common Lisp utilities

  These tools are meant as an incremental extension to the facilities defined by ANSI Common Lisp.

  This code is under the MIT license, so you can use it more or less however you wish. If you find a bug in the code, have a feature suggestion, or just want to complain about how stupidly I've done something, please let me know. Ideally, the code here would be bug-free, fast, and portable, but it is /rather/ unlikely to meet all of these requirements at a first pass, so don't take it for granted that any of these holds. Bug fixes and test cases are especially welcome.
